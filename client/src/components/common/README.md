# Common Components

This directory contains reusable UI components that are shared across the application.

## Purpose

Common components are generic, UI-focused components that can be used in multiple places throughout the app.

## Examples of components to be added:

- `Button.jsx` - Reusable button component with variants
- `Input.jsx` - Form input component with validation styling
- `Card.jsx` - Container component for content cards
- `Modal.jsx` - Modal/dialog component
- `Spinner.jsx` - Loading spinner component
- `Alert.jsx` - Alert/notification component
- `Badge.jsx` - Badge component for labels/tags

## Guidelines

- Keep components simple and focused on a single responsibility
- Make components highly reusable and configurable via props
- Use PropTypes or TypeScript for type safety
- Follow consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components)
- Include proper documentation and usage examples
